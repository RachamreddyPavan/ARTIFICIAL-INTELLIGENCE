  <p>Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science which is capable of performing the
    tasks that require human intelligence. In general, this is abbreviated as AI. This artificial
    intelligence is developed by humans to perform the tasks easier and quicker. This works
    on the commands given by the user to perform the tasks. When the user gives the
    command, the artificial intelligence completes the work that was assigned by the user
    with the help of the program installed in it and gives the final output which reduces
    human effort and work.</p>

    <h2 style="color: green;">Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <img src="AICOM.jpg" height="300" width="500">
    <p><b>Weak AI</b>: It works on the project assigned by the user and completes it according to
      program included in it <br>
     <p><b> Strong AI</b>: It can perform any task that a human perform. (researchers are working on
      this kind)</p> 
      <p><b>Super AI</b>: The AI which surpasses human intelligence. (probable concept)</p>
      <br>
      <h2 style="color: yellowgreen;">Advantages of AI</h2>
      <p><b>Reduces wastage of time</b>- AI performs the work faster when compared to humans
        through which it enhances the scope of reducing the time required to complete the task.
        It helps in completing the work quicker than humans.</p>
        
        <p><b>Reduces error</b>- It helps in reducing the error in the result when compared to humans in
          some cases and helps giving the accurate result.</p>
          
        <p><b>Work time</b> - The AI can do the work at any time whereas a human can perform the
          work only during a time period and for a limited amount of time. </p>
          
          <p><b>Unbiased decisions</b> - AI gives the information without any biasedness towards any
            aspect.</p>
            
            <p><b>Reduces risks</b> - AI reduces the risks in the process and result when compared to
              humans.</p>

              <h2 style="color: red;">Disadvantages of AI</h2>
              <img src="AI3.jpg"height="300" width="500">
              <p><b>Higher Costs</b> - To create an AI which have human intelligence will take a lot of cost.</p>
              
              <p><b>Lack of creativity</b> - AI cannot perform the tasks out the program it has whereas a
                human brain can think in many creative ways.</p>
                
                <p><b>Unemployment</b>- Advancement of AI is reducing the human work labour and
                  opportunities of employment. It is leading to increase in unemployment.</p>
                  
                  <p><b>No Emotion</b>- AI makes the decisions without any emotional thinking when compared
                    to humans which is not appropriate in some cases.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Reducing Human Creativity</b> - AI is making humans to become lazy by limiting their
                      capability of creative thinking and making them dependent</p>
